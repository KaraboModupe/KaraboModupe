    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Karabo Modupe is a motivational speaker, writer, and mental health advocate whose story is rooted in resilience and transformation. Born and raised in Mokopane, Limpopo, and now based in Johannesburg, Karabo has walked a path through depression, alcoholism, and the painful reality of hitting rock bottom.

At the age of 27, he reached a breaking point that forced him to confront the truth about his struggles. With the support of his family, therapy, and rehab, he made the brave decision to rebuild his life — piece by piece. Today, Karabo uses his journey as proof that healing and recovery are possible, no matter how deep the fall.

Through raw storytelling and unfiltered honesty, he inspires audiences to face their own challenges, embrace vulnerability, and believe in the power of starting over. Karabo’s mission is simple: to be the voice he once needed — a reminder that even in silence, no one has to drown alone.

Karabo is also the author of “Drowning Loudly in Silence: Journal Entries of a Fucked Up Trying Man,” a deeply personal book that captures his journey through addiction, depression, and recovery. Written in raw journal-entry style, the book is both a confession and a promise — a message to anyone who feels broken that they are not beyond saving. It will be available on Amazon, Google Books, and select bookstores. Signed copies can be requested directly through him.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I didn’t come from sunshine and straight roads.
I came from hangovers that felt like death.
From nights where the bottle tucked me in better than hope ever did.
From mornings where an old mattress was the only thing that remembered my name.

At 27, I had nothing.
Not even myself.

They call it rock bottom — but it’s not a metaphor.
It’s the floor you hit when your soul gives up before your body does.
And that’s where I found myself.

But here’s the twist: rock bottom became my starting line.
With therapy, with rehab, with a family that refused to bury me alive I clawed my way back.
Not clean. Not perfect. But alive.

Now I live sober, one day at a time.
Now I speak, I write, I tell the truth I once drowned.
Not because my story is special, but because survival always is.

This is my journey.
Messy. Loud. Honest.
And if you take anything from it — let it be this:
No pit is too deep, no silence too heavy, no past too ugly to rewrite.</p>
